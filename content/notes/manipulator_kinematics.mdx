## Kinematics

We model robots as tree-like structures with a collection of rigid **links**, connected via **joints**.

### Joints

A joint allows a relative motion between the two links it interconnects, and is often modelled as either a revolute or prismatic joint. A revolute joint allows a relative rotation between the two links, while a prismatic joint allows a relative translation.

### Forward Kinematics

The position of any link can be computed by the forward kinematics of the robot, which is a function of the joint angles. The forward kinematics for a serial chain robot is given by:

$$
H_i^0(q)=H_1^0\left(q_1\right) H_2^1\left(q_2\right) \cdots H_n^{n-1}\left(q_n\right)=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
            R_n^0(q)   & r_n^0(q) \\
            \mathbf{0} & 1
        \end{array}\right]
$$

where $H_i^j(q)$ is the homogeneous transformation matrix from frame $0$ to frame $n$ along the robot's kinematic chain. Note, the forward kinematics of a non-serial chain robot is non-trivial to compute using the above equation but it must be ensured that the correct path is taken from the source to the target link in the kinematic chain.

## Jacobian

The jacobian is a matrix which gives the relationship between the joint velocities and the linear and angular velocity of the robots end effector/point of interest.

$$
  v = J(q)\dot{q}\space
$$

We can split the jacobian two parts, the linear velocity jacobian and the angular velocity jacobian:

$$
  J(q)=\begin{bmatrix} J_v\\J_w \end{bmatrix}
$$

with

$$
v^0_n=J_v(q)\dot{q} \\ \omega^0_n=J_w(q)\dot{q}
$$

where $v^0_n$ and $\omega^0_n$ are the linear and angular velocity of the end effector/point of interest respectively, $J_v(q)$ and $J_w(q)$ are the linear and angular velocity jacobians respectively, and $\dot{q}$ is the joint velocity vector.

### Computing the Jacobian

Computing the Jacobian is relatively simple, each column is related to a joint, the entries of the column depend on whether the joint is prismatic or revolute:

$$

\textbf{J} =\begin{bmatrix} \textbf{J}_v\\ \textbf{J}_w \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} \textbf{J}_{v1} && \textbf{J}_{v2} && \dots&& \textbf{J}_{vn}\\ \textbf{J}_{w1} && \textbf{J}_{w2} && \dots && \textbf{J}_{wn} \end{bmatrix}


$$

$$

\textbf{J} =\begin{bmatrix} \textbf{J}_{vi}\\ \textbf{J}_{wi}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{cases}\begin{bmatrix} z^0_{i-1}\\J_w \end{bmatrix} \text{for prismatic}\\ \\
\begin{bmatrix} S(z^0_{i-1})(r^0_{n/0}-r^0_{i-1/0})\\z^0_{i-1}\end{bmatrix} \text{for revolute}
\end{cases}


$$

$$

z^0_{i-1}=R^0_1(q_1)R^1_2(q_2)\dots R^{i-2}_{i-1}(q_1)[0,0,1]^T


$$
