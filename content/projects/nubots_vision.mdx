A vision module for detecting and estimating the Cartesian position of the following objects:

- Balls
- Goals
- Robots
- Field Intersections (X, L, T)

Trained using the Torso21 data set (https://github.com/bit-bots/TORSO_21_dataset) and YoloV8 https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

Inference is achieved at 100 fps on GPU onboard an intel NUC using https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino which is optimized for intel hardware.

Example results:
